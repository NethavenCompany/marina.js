# Marina.js

Marina is a UI toolkit designed for vanilla JavaScript. It's a library of common interface elements I have found myself needing whenever I'm making a simple landing page or website with vanilla JS; like: carousels, tooltips, modals, utility functions and a bunch of icons— all built using vanilla js, no frameworks or dependencies.

## Installation

> Note: This project is still in early development and doesn't have a release yet.

Marina will be available via both NPM and CDNs such as jsDelivr.
